While some more devoted citizens to the Solar Empress have begun to stirrup unrest whenever they can, the majority of the Canterlot’s population has welcomed Princess Twilight with open hooves and even the remains of the Canterlot nobility offered to host a extravagant festival in honor of Twilight, grateful to be free from the tyranny of Daybreaker.

 twiquestria.2.d:0 "After Celestia's transformation into Daybreaker Princes Twilight Sparkle vanished from Canterlot. Many had thought her captured but later last evening she showed up in Ponyville and declared herself independent from the Solar Empire and Lunar Empire. This development has come as quite a shock to everyone on the continent and has even left some soldiers on both sides of the civil war hesitant. Twilight is well known for her heroism and service to Equestria and that thought alone has made some unease, weither that be out of fear of harming such a beloved heroine or fear that she may be an actual threat remains to be seen."
 twiquestria.2.a:0 "Foolish mare knows nothing about ruling a nation"

 twiquestria.3.t:0 "Twilight's Speach"
 twiquestria.3.d:0 "Ponyville town center is crowded as ponies wait anxiously for their princess to arrive to give her speech. After several tense minutes of waiting she arrives and makes her way onto the wood stage to give her speech. Everypony has gone silent and looks at their princess with worry and concern. Twilight surveys the crowd of ponies. Her ponies. They were her subjects now and it was her duty to protect them and look out for them, that’s what made it hard knowing she would have to send them into battle to possibly die if she wanted to win this war. Twilight took a deep breath and began her speech.\n\n“I can see it,” she begins. “You’re all scared. You’re all anxious and are uncertain about what’s going to happen; So am I. I’m also afraid, anxious, and uncertain of what to do next. I never expected something like this to happen, but it’s happening and there is nothing I could do to stop it. Now my mentor and a close friend have become twisted versions of themselves and have torn Equestria apart in the process, and I did nothing to prevent it!” She yelled in frustration tears began to fall from her eyes. She quickly lit her horn to wipe the tears from her eyes and took a deep breath. She stamped the wood stage roughly with her left hoof. “But I’m done sitting by! I won’t take it anymore! I will not sit by as the harmony that I spent years protecting is destroyed and the nation I love is ripped apart in the process. I will not stand and watch as everything I strived for is abandoned. I will not stand by and watch those I love and care for suffering any longer! But I can’t do it alone! I need your support, but I’m not asking you to help me as your princess I want and need your support as a friend, because that is how we will win this war; as friends fighting side by side!” She finishes with a triumphant tone.\n\nThe ponies are silent for a few seconds before the entire crowd bursts into cheering and stomping of approval. Twiligth smiles and feels a great sense of pride fills her chest."

 twiquestria.17.t:0 "The Power of Harmony"
 twiquestria.17.d:0 "Twilight and her five friends stepped into the room. Both Daybreaker and Nightmare were held to the floor by white glowing chains that also warped around their bodies holding down their wings and wrapping around their horns.\n\n“Well, look who has shown up, the little goddess way over her head.” Nightmare sneered at Twilight.\n\n”I’m rather disappointed in you, Twilight what happened to you being my faithful student?” Daybreaker asked trying hard to guilt the younger alicorn.\n\n”It appears you taught her too well, now because of you we are both trapped here.” Nightmare snarled. Daybreaker scoffed and turned her head away from her sister.\n\n”I should have killed you a thousand years ago banishment was too good for you!” she snapped.\n\n”You’re a selfish and pompous fool! You should have been the one to suffer and not me!” Nightmare yelled back. The two goddesses struggled against their chains in an attempt to attack each other, but it was no use, the magic chains held fast.\n\n”Enough!” Twilight yelled drawing the attention of the two alicorns back to her. “You both lost and now I’m going to use the power of harmony to return you to your true selves, just sit quietly accept your defeat,” Twilight said sternly like she was scolding a child. She nodded to her friends to begin which they returned with a nod of their own. With a flash of light, the six mares entered their harmonic forms. From her five friends magic flowed into Twilight as she wielded the power of Harmony against the two corrupt goddesses. She dug deep into their souls in search for that spark of good in them… she found nothing.\n\n”What? NO! There has to be good in them!” she yelled as panic began to fill her. She desperately searched their souls for any sign of good in them, but there was nothing. Desperately she tried to pull back the power of Harmony, but instead of obeying her it continued on; eating away at the two corrupted goddesses. Twilight could feel their magic entering into her and joining hers. “NO! NO! NO! STOP!” she pleaded desperately, but it was no use, Harmony continued to transfer the magic of the light and dark into Twilight as Daybreaker and Nightmare faded from the world. Eventually, the power of Harmony ceased and vanished as the six ponies fell out of their Harmonic forms. Twilight collapsed to the floor wrecked with sobs of absolute despair. Her five friends looked on with both confusion and horror as they all realized what happened and that there was no Celestia or Luna standing before them. Celestia and Luna were dead, the sun and moon have chosen a new master, and Equestria would now have only one goddess ruling over it; Twilight Sparkle."
 twiquestria.17.a:0 "NO!"
 twiquestria.18.t:0 "The Funeral"
 twiquestria.18.d:0 "Today is a sad day. On this day a funeral was held in Canterlot for the late princesses; Celestia and Luna. Many ponies from across the country have come to pay their respects and even more from across the world. Princess Twilight Sparkle was not seen at the ceremony, many believe she has retreated into the castle to mourn the loss of her mentor and close friend in silence. What happens next no one knows and has caused many to lose hope in the future. Many wish that there last remaining princess would come out to tell them that they have nothing to fear, but alas she has remained locked away in self-imposed isolation..."

 twiquestria.19.d:0 "On this memorable day, Princess Twilight and her Equestrian forces have successfully removed the Lunar Empire from the city where their rebellion started: Manehattan. To the surprise of Princess Twilight, it appears that Nightmare Moon had already evacuated the city beforehand and established herself elsewhere, perhaps believing that Twilight would be accompanied by the other Elements of Harmony so that they may defeat her once more. Outwardly disappointed that Nightmare Moon could not have been captured but secretly relieved that she didn’t have to face her former friend, Twilight accompanied her soldiers as they lowered Lunar Flags and replaced them with Equestrian ones all while also reassuring any citizens she (rarely) passed by that she means to do no harm to the city and being met with mixed responses, many citizens seeming to have atleast some loyalty to the Lunar cause. Infront of Manehattan’s symbolic statue, Princess Twilight has promised that no persecution against Thestrals or other supposed Lunar loyalists will take place and has even offered amnesty to those who actively fought for Nightmare Moon, stating that she believed that their reasons for doing so are understandable and even just in certain examples. While this has led to some grumbling by Equestria’s High Command, seeing this as a weak point the enemy will exploit, the common press has been praising the Princess for her mercy and somepony truly worthy of succeeding Princess Celestia (who, by orders of Twilight, to be referred as a different being detached from Empress Daybreaker). With the lost of Manehattan, it’s uncertain how long Nightmare Moon and her Lunar Empire can continue to fight in this war, already it is said that some other nations with similar...ideologies have approached the Lunar Empress and offered her refuge, only to be banished by the now-enraged Alicorn."

In the morning, Princess Twilight held a speech infront of Canterlot Castle before a crowd, expressing that, while she was devastated to see her former home in such a condition, is overjoyed that Solar tyranny has been removed from the beating heart of Equestria and promises that Canterlot will be restored its former glory once the tyrants Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon are brought to justice. Continuing on, she warns everypony to remain vigilant, in order to ensure that Canterlot never falls once again. While her words ring true for many, others believe that the war has now been decided. While Empress Daybreaker is still out there and determined to oppose both Twilight and Nightmare Moon, the lost of Daybreaker’s most vital city could prove to be the straw that breaks the morale of her Imperial soldiers.

With a flap of her own wings, Daybreker follows close behind Twilight as they exit the thrown room flying through the halls of Canterlot castle at a breakneck speed. The two alicorns weave back and forth through the halls of the castle in a deadly game of cat and mouse as one tried to cut off the other’s path while the other desperately tried to find a way to escape.

However, the gravity spell could only hold the enraged Sun-Goddess for so long, and Daybreker was finally able to get back to her hooves, but only after Twilight had made it to the outskirts if she got out of the city there would be no way she would be able to chase after her without losing control of Canterlot.

 twiquestria.205.d:0 "Twilight continued to fly low towards her mentor, however, when she was just a few meters from the larger alicorn Twilight flipped around so her back hooves would impact Daybrekaer first. Unfortunately, Daybreaker was more skilled than Twilight had originally thought. Just before Twilight collided with her Daybreaker grabbed hold of the smaller alicorn and with a flap of her wings, she flipped the two of them into the air turning Twilight’s horizontal momentum into circular. Twilight was flipped over and back down on to the floor which cracked under the force of her impact. All the air was forced out of her lungs. Daybreaker had caught her."

 twiquestria.206.t:0 "Go over her head."
 twiquestria.206.d:0 "Twilight pushed her self towards the ceiling of the long hall and pumped her wings as hard as she could push them. By the time she reached Daybreakers position a cone of air had begun to form in front of her. However, Twilight had foolishly forgotten that she was facing an alicorn. Daybreaker met her in the air and caught the speedy purple alicorn. The two of them were sent careening out of the castle’s entrance. The two wrestled in the air; twilight desperately trying to escape her mentor's grip, and daybreak trying to keep hold of her student. Ultimately Twilight was no match for Daybreakers superior strength."

 twiquestria.207.t:0 "Towards The Dungeon"
 twiquestria.207.d:0 "Twilight makes her way deeper into the castle as she gets closer and closer to the dungeons. They were rarely used so, for the time being, she doubted she would be caught. However, she felt like it would be a good idea to keep the cloaking spells on just in case, then again they were a constant drain on her power. It would be best if she…."
 twiquestria.207.a:0 "Keep the Stealth spells"

 twiquestria.208.t:0 "Towards The Library"
 twiquestria.208.d:0 "Twilight needed more information to decide her next move, and the best place to get that information was the library. Twilight quickly made her way towards the castle library being sure to keep her cloaking spells active at all times. She quickly arrived at the library and made her way inside. However, she walked right into a trap and her cloaking spells were torn apart. Daybreaker quickly descended on her and pinned her to the floor."
 twiquestria.208.a:0 "“You’re all too predictable Twilight.”"
 
 twiquestria.209.t:0 "Towards The Exit"
 twiquestria.209.d:0 "She needed to get out quickly it was only a matter of time before she was caught. Moving quickly she made her way to the castle entrance as quickly as she could without compromising her disguise. It only took her a few minutes to make her way to the castle’s main entrance. Unfortunately, Daybreaker had expected her to go this way because as soon as she passed the threshold of the main entrance her cloaking spells were torn right off of her as a magic circle formed around her hooves that shot golden chains up to ensnare her. Twilight struggled desperately to escape the magical chains, but it was no use, and soon Daybreaker came along to collect her prize."
 twiquestria.209.a:0 "“You need to be more clever than that to outsmart me.”"
 
 twiquestria.210.t:0 "Breaking Through it!"
 twiquestria.210.d:0 "Twilight tapped deep into her magic pool. A deep lavender aura surrounded her horn and blazed furiously with might. Harder and herder she beat her wings to the point that a mach-cone formed in front of her. Faster and faster she flew as she approached the shield and her magic blazed brighter with each passing second. Finally, just before she reached the sheild she broke through the sound barrier and released her magic. She shot through the shield shattering it completely and shooting across the land like a blazing purple comet leaving behind a brilliant magic trail in her wake."

 twiquestria.211.t:0 "Teleport Past it!"
 twiquestria.211.d:0 "Channeling her magic the teleport spell quickly forms in her mind along with her desired destination. Once the spell fully formed she released it ripping a hole in the fabric of space and slipping through it. In the void between the planes of existence, etherial chains shot out of the darkness and grabbed hold of her. The etherial chains pulled her back into the normal plane of existence; Right into the waiting hooves of Daybreaker. \n\n “There you are my faithful student, I knew you would come back to me,” Daybreaker smiled evilly."
 twiquestria.211.a:0 "Daybreaker knew Twilight would try to teleport at some point."
 
 twiquestria.212.t:0 "Keep the Cloack"
 twiquestria.212.d:0 "Twilight continues on with the Cloak, it’s best to not let her guard down. She couldn’t afford being spotted at all. As she trotted closer to the dungeon she felt it; a breeze, one she wouldn’t have felt if she wasn’t being cautious. That seemed rather impossible this deep into the castle unless there was an opening somewhere. She followed the direction the breeze was coming from and came to a brick wall in the bowels of the castle, just at the dungeon’s entrance. There was air coming from the other side of the wall. Twilight noticed a brick out of place and on instinct pressed her hoof against it. The brick was pushed flush with the rest of the wall and the sound of stone rubbing against stone filled the hall before a section of the wall just slightly further to the right pulled back and down revealing a hidden passage. After looking to see if anyone was around to see that there was a hidden entrance here she hurried through and the wall closed back up behind her."

 twiquestria.213.t:0 "Drop the Cloak"
 twiquestria.213.d:0 "Twilight didn’t want to risk using up all her magic and seeing she was deep enough in the castle’s bowels that she doubted there would be anyone there to find her for quite some time, she dispelled her cloak. She continued her way into the dungeons trying to think of what her next move would be. She remained there for several hours until guards came escorting multiple prisoners and she was discovered. Twilight tried to make a run for it, but Daybreaker cornered her."

 twiquestria.214.d:0 "Twilight eventually slowed her flight to a more sustainable pace once she was a few kilometers from Canterlot. She was on her way to Ponyville now to enact her plan. A plan that she was still formulating and a plan she needed to have completed in her mind before she arrived in the little town that had become her home for the last several years of her life. As her plan took form so did doubts, doubts that made her question if she could actually do this. Twilight shook her head to clear away the doubt, she couldn’t afford to let it cloud her thoughts or she wouldn’t have a chance at succeeding. She continued to fly and formulate her strategy further. Soon Ponyville was in sight and she would be landing in a few hours."

 twiquestria.215.d:0 "Finally after hours of walking through that secret passage Twilight was outside, at the base of Canterlot mountain. She surveyed the area to find that there was no one around to see her so she finally let some of her cloaking spells drop, but only the most magic intensive ones. She didn’t want to risk getting captured, not after making it this far. After getting her bearings down she began her treck to Ponyville with hast. She had begun developing a plan of action while she had been in that tunnel and was now putting the finishing touches on it. After a few hours of trotting quickly she spread her wings and began flying the rest of the way to Ponyville. She needed to enact her plans as soon as she got there."

First she found Rainbow Dash and gave her a quick rundown on the situation. After being informed on what her task was Dash headed straight for Cloudsdale. Twilight then hurried to town hall to inform mayor mare of the situation. Within a few hours all of ponyville had started mobilizing and ponies where running all over the place getting ready for what was about to take place. Around midnight Twilight arrived at her castle, and made her way to her room. She would sleep for a few hours before she would begin putting her plans in full motion."
